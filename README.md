# destiny
This project is an interactive story-based web application inspired by the movie Mamma Mia. It allows users to explore multiple narrative paths by making choices that affect the storyline and outcome of the main character’s life. The application dynamically updates images, text, and available options based on user decisions, creating a branching scenario experience. The project focuses on DOM manipulation, event handling, and conditional logic to deliver an engaging, choice-driven interaction without page reloads.
